          I was invited by Katrin Mayer to join in the investigation of her
          speculative question of what a feminist perspective on code might look
          like. We began collaboratively researching into internet history and
          were especially interested in thinking about where code came from, how
          it was made, how it looked and what it could look like. Code,
          computing and programming are of course inextricably linked to the
          history of technology and the people who operated it; turns out, they
          were women. Conditioned to think of computing as a predominantly male
          domain, we were fascinated to learn of its female origins thanks to
          excellent research done on this topic in recent years, and are excited
          to see how a feminist rewriting of computing history is well under way
          today.

          ><br />Computer has two separate yet related meanings. A computer,
          from the early 17th century and up until the first half of the 20th
          century, referred to “someone who computes.” It was a person whom, by
          hand, performed time-consuming and tedious mathematical calculations.
          As the work of such Computers was akin to secretarial work, it was
          often the work of women.
        </p>

        <p class="">
          Amongst the earliest technological innovations that would change the
          idea of what we now understand as “computing” was the Analytical
          Engine by Charles Babbage. He is widely credited as the inventor of
          the machine (the hardware, though a term coined much later) while his
          associate, mathematician and Computer Ada Lovelace, was the brilliant
          mind that conceived of its algorithms (what we now call software),
          left unrecognized for a century.
        </p>
        <p

          <span class="text-sm material-symbols-outlined"> arrow_forward </span
          ><br />The Analytical Engine would never be completed, but it
          represents the conceptual dawn of the computer age. (...) the
          strikingly original notes that Ada prepared to explain this new kind
          of machine would presage the literature of computer science by nearly
          a century. To demonstrate how the engine could calculate Bernoulli
          Numbers without any assistance from a “human hand or head,” she wrote
          mathemathical proofs that many scholars characterize as the first
          computer programs ever written (...).
          <br />
          (...) she was the first to consider that a machine could have
          applications beyond pure calculations (...).

        <p class="">
          But the Analytical Engine was yet too far ahead of its time, and while
          more efforts were made to invent technology that would aid in
          computing, data had to be processed and calculated painstakingly by
          hand. The fields of mathematics, astronomy and physics were dependant
          on the work of human Computers, many of them women. There was a
          widespread biologistical belief that the meticulousness and patience
          necessary to doing this kind of work were supposedly inherent “female”
          traits, “women’s work.” Though it enabled women to enter the workforce
          and strive toward some level of independence, the female prevalence in
          these jobs was in truth mostly due to the fact that they were paid
          much lower wages. It was when computing power was measured in “kilo
          girls”: 1000 hours of (female) computing labour.

          ><br />These women quite literally mapped the cosmos, but their wages
          were equivalent to those of unskilled workers (...), they earned
          barely more than they would have if they’d worked in a factory.

          With time, typewriters, switchboards, computers: As women were seen as
          mere “operators” of machines, their work was assumed to be “more
          handicraft than science” and thus “more mechanical than
          intellectual” 6. However, the true merit of their work was just harder
          to spot than the more tangible developments in engineering, a field
          mainly dominated by men. These womens’ lasting accomplishment was in
          fact running, performing, and virtually embodying what was becoming a
          global informational infrastructure.

          ><br />(...) For a few centuries, groups of women working in hives and
          “harems” were the hardware (...). It’s the accumulation of all those
          steps, executed simultaneously and collectively, that prefigured our
          connected, caclulating, big-data world. Alone, women were the first
          computers; together, they formed the first information networks. (...)
          Long before we came to understand the network as an extension of
          ourselves, our great-grandmothers were performing the functions that
          brought about its existence.

        <p class="">
          I thought about how what I am seeing while programming this website
          might relate to the work these women were doing. Using technology,
          virtual models of thinking, working intimately with text-as-data. The
          way code looks until this day has its origin here: “Typing” meant
          using machinery that by its design determined its characteristic
          visuality. 
        </p>

        <p class="">
          In the beginning, typewriters did not differentiate between the widths
          of individual letters, and thus each letter was printed with the same
          width. This meant that some particularly wide letters (like the m and
          most uppercase letters) had to be squeezed to fit the space, and
          others (such as i, l, I) had to be modified to fill out more space, as
          to not cause too many gaps in the text. 
        </p>
        <img

        </div>

        <p class="">
          The necessary letter modifications resulted in a new genre of
          monospaced typefaces. They turned out to be particularly useful for
          clearly distinguishing letters, for writing data in an orderly manner,
          and for helping the eye compare lines and layout. All of this is still
          vital when writing and reading code, and so this choice of typeface
          has prevailed in programming until today.

          ><br />No one really knew how to program the room-sized machine – the
          only thing that existed were the wiring diagrams representing the
          physical layout of the machine. (...)As programming languages did not
          yet exist, they then physically wired the program by fixing cables and
          flicking the machine’s switches in the sequences they had developed.
          The positions of those switches and cables were the program. By
          training themselves to program the ENIAC, they invented and developed
          major computing concepts which are still widely used by programmers
          today, such as nested loops for example.
        </p>
        <p>
          I began to think about the connections between text and code; letters
          and technology; between typing, writing and coding. But before
          algorithms were written, typed or punched, they were wired. It was
          women who were tasked with figuring out the machine; and by doing so,
          they invented software programming.

          However, despite their doubtless pioneering innovations and the
          significant importance of their intellectual work, they were not
          credited. Instead, they were often portrayed either more as the
          computer’s mechanics or pretty photo models hired to pose in front of
          it.

          ><br />When the ENIAC was finally unveiled to the public in 1946,
          there was no mention of the women who made it run and effectively
          invented modern programming. A 1946 New York Times article announcing
          the “amazing machine,” only credits the male inventors John Mauchly
          and J. Presper Eckert.(...) the ENIAC Six (as the women who programmed
          the ENIAC became known) were almost erased from history.

          Punchcards, though not an entirely new technology, were adopted from
          around 1930 to write and store programs and data. Punchcards had
          already been used since the 18th century to operate weaving looms and
          store pattern instructions – another example of a traditionally female
          occupation at the intersection between information technology and
          manual labour. The job of the data typist emerged. This was what code
          looked like for at least half a century: typed and punched, on paper.

          This type of data storage transmits data through holes and non-holes,
          through binary logic, on/off, the zeroes and ones that machines
          understand. Of course, this is not how humans process information, so
          some kind of translation needed to happen between human language and
          machine language, between words and calculations. Grace Hopper, a
          female computer scientist, effected a major breakthrough in how
          machines and humans now talk to each other. She thought that code
          should be written in human language.

          Grace Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist known for
          popularizing the idea that programming languages could be independent
          from machines, and that an English-based language was possible. (...)
          She recalls: “(...) It’s much easier for most people to write an
          English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data
          processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and
          the computers would translate them into machine code. (...) I would
          say ‘Subtract income tax from pay’ instead of trying to write that in
          octal code or using all kinds of symbols.”

          Programming today carries her legacy. First and foremost, code is a
          language, with syntax and grammar and vocabulary, plus some logic. We
          can invent code much like a sentence, choosing the words that fit
          best. Code is text both in the sense that it is composed by letters
          and that it can be written and read.
        </p>

        <p>
          When thinking about Hoppers legacy, language and the readabilitiy of
          code, one might ask: Who actually reads the code? In the case of this
          website, I write code for the browser to read, interpret, execute. The
          browser is my audience. And not only does it speak a different
          language, it has a wholly different way of reading. Did you know that
          spaces take browsers just the same time to read as actual letters?
          Every glyph typed – even if it is a blank space – results in
          information stored, and corresponds to storage space or file size.
          This is why proper programmers storetheircodewithoutspaces. The
          absence of a letter is not nothing, blank space not 0.

        <p>
          The only humans reading the code I write is myself and possibly other
          coders working on it with me, who are likely already tuned into
          conventional abstractions and lazy shortcuts. Go to your favourite
          website, right click, inspect the code. Can you read what’s going on?
          We thought – but then how could code be written as humanly readable as
          possible, even for those who don’t code? Please right click right here
          and inspect this website’s code. Disclaimer: Writing code that is both
          functional to browsers and readable to humans leads to many
          inefficient workarounds and plenty of failure, because without keeping
          some symbolic and syntactical conventions, browsers would quite simply
          not understand. But maybe try it, climb all the way up, then travel
          down and go inside.

          I hope it becomes clear how the code was written hand in hand with its
          design and named by its content; a conceptional attempt – ambitious
          and doomed – to place central emphasis on being able to navigate the
          website just based on its source code, even through the non-coder’s
          eye.

          The letters in code are data and thus stand purely for the information
          of which symbol is used. But this information is manifested as letters
          of a certain shape; they are not only read but seen, too. Every text
          needs a typeface. This text, this code, this website needed a
          typeface.
        </p>

        <p>
          Early typewriters usually came with one typeface built right into the
          machine. The introduction of changeable typefaces moved the typewriter
          one step closer to becoming a modern productive word processor and
          precursor of today’s desktop computers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The IBM Selectric, released in 1961, was one of the first machines
          where fonts could be switched easily and characters could be stored on
          a magnetic band, making it thus an important bridge technology between
          typewriter and computer.
        </p>
        <p
          class="lg:hidden footnote font-mono text-[15px] max-w-[40ch] font-light text-purple-600 md:text-black lg:text-purple-600"
        >
          <span class="text-sm material-symbols-outlined"> arrow_forward </span
          ><br />
          At the physical heart of the Selectric typewriter’s innovation was a
          golf-ball-shaped type head that replaced the conventional typewriter’s
          basket of type bars. The design eliminated the bane of rapid typing:
          jammed type bars. And with no bars to jam, typists’ speed and
          productivity soared.
          <br />
          <br />
          One other innovation in the design—a changeable typeface—was borrowed
          from a turn-of-the-century model, the Blickensderfer typewriter. (...)
          By making the golf ball interchangeable, the Selectric enabled
          different fonts, including italics, scientific notation and other
          languages, to be swapped in. With the addition in 1964 of a magnetic
          tape system for storing characters, the Magnetic Tape Selectric
          Typewriter (MT/ST) model became the first, albeit analog,
          word-processor device.
          <br /><br />
          Less well-known is the Selectric typewriter’s role as one of the first
          computer terminals. (...) A modified version of the Selectric, dubbed
          the IBM 2741 Terminal, was adapted to plug into the System/360, and
          enabled a wider range of engineers and researchers to begin talking to
          and interacting with their computers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dual Basic was one of the many typefaces available for the Selectric.
          I liked the typeface for its openness and clarity; also, it lacks the
          usual modifications done on monospaced typefaces to fill visual holes.
          It is almost like a text typeface only with equalized widths; it
          seemed like an interesting in-between, unsure of which technology or
          age to belong to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found that in my investigation into all this, the harder I looked,
          the blurrier the lines became between coding, writing and typing.
          Might the distinction between them be simply determined by my choice
          of typeface and machinery? For coding, I use a code editor and a
          monospaced font, because it is easier for reading text that is code.
          For writing, I use a proportionally spaced typeface, because it is
          easier for reading text that is not code. In both cases, I press
          buttons, I type.
        </p>
        <p>
          The typeface you are reading and seeing now is Coda, designed as part
          of this project. It is based on the framework of Dual Basic and
          modified in two directions: In one, whitespace is taken out, and the
          monospaced becomes proportional, much nicer for reading this text
          right now. In the other direction, fictional serifs are added, to
          transform it into a fully functional coding typeface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every letter and every way a letter’s line is made, drawn, chiseled or
          printed has a historical and technological provenance. Today,
          typefaces are produced digitally; they are software, they are code,
          thus themselves written and composed of text. We can think about
          variables, interaction, output. Code is text is type is font is code?

          Something happened to the generation of programmers after Grace Hopper
          and her peers. Although (...) women were being encouraged to pursue
          programming as an alternative to secretarial work, the field was
          quickly becoming far less welcoming to women than it had been even a
          decade before. (...) Instead of running departments and advancing
          their art, they were starting to cluster “at the lower end of the
          occupational pool” (...).
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me tie at least one of many loose ends here. You may rightfully
          wonder: what happened to women programmers? Why is the image we have
          of a programmer today automatically, reflexively, that of a man? I
          have mentioned the wage discrimination that had been structurally
          present from the moment women entered the modern workforce. There was
          also an unwillingness by computer companies to provide models of work
          that would help to balance childcare with a career. And as computing
          developed into an increasingly important and profitable industry, the
          image, value and requirements of the profession changed profoundly.
        </p>
        <p>
          A conference held in 1968 to address the so-called “software crisis”
          (a consequence of programming’s difficulty to keep up with ever
          accelerating technological progress) initiated a movement to re-brand
          programming as “software engineering.” What sounds like a merely
          semantic change would however come to have far-reaching implications,
          determining who could gain access to the field and who couldn’t.
        </p>
        <p

          As such, it would be treated like a branch of engineering (...). This
          change signaled a larger renegotiation of computing’s professional
          status that would unfold through professional journals and societies,
          hiring practices, and certification programs throughout the 1960s and
          1970s. The more the discipline professionalized, the more it grew
          implicitly masculine. The introduction of formal educational
          prerequisites for programming jobs, for example, made it harder for
          self-taught programmers to find employment – a change that penalized
          female candidates, particularly those who might have taken time off
          from school to raise children, above all. If computing “began as
          women’s work,” writes historian Nathan Ensmenger, “it had to be made
          masculine.”

          Women faded from the profession. They were never truly gone, but
          harder to be found. There were still women where networks were formed;
          hypertexts created; knowledge organised; search engines built; message
          boards hosted; connections drawn... But the landscape of computing,
          and the idea of what it represents and how it’s represented, changed
          to such an extent that female contributions were in many parts
          forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is of course an incomplete history, told subjectively through the
          lens of Katrins and my research, the books we read, the course of our
          conversations, personal interests and own experiences. I never had or
          knew of female programmer role models. The suggestion to code my own
          website and not use Geocities for the homepage of my email writing
          club came from my stepfather, a software engineer, and sparked my
          fascination with what pure text can create. Though off to an early
          start, programming was never in the realm of what I considered for my
          professional future, because I simply never knew that someone like me
          could be doing something like that. It took me a long time to realize
          that if I wanted to see it, I needed to be it – or at least try to.

          I am happy to see more women, now; again. This research has been
          instrumental in discovering somewhat of a 1ineage. This is the
          structure of the web’s native tongue, a programming language called
          HTML. It is especially prone to endless fractal-like nesting of
          elements inside and alongside one another. Structures are built with a
          syntax that wraps, creates vessels, holds, embraces, stacks, plunges,
          births. Thus, web code knows words and concepts of inheritance and
          ancestry.

          :first-child, :nth-child(n), :last-child, children, childrenNodes,
          siblings(), nextSibling, parentNode, parent(), parents(),
          parentsUntil(), gparent(), just to name a few. This is what it looks
          like:

          Thankfully, we do not write code on empty sheets of paper anymore. We
          use code editors; fancy text programs that do all kinds of things to
          help find our way in the matrix. There, lines have proven to be the
          most efficient crumbs for finding back, connecting beginnings and
          ends. Looking at our digital interfaces, lines often signal traces
          back to an origin, to the first element, post, tweet or email.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were also reminded of the warps in fabrics, vertically structuring
          a textile piece that back in the day might have been programmed by
          punchcards, ancestors to the code written here. The lines you can see
          on this website visualise how the code of this website looks in the
          moment of coding it. Its design mirrors its code, shows the process,
          reveals its own making, in a way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lines have a way of accumulating the more we write, the deeper we dig
          and the longer we go. It means something is building: software,
          patterns, conversations, layers, story. These lines we can create
          ourselves; they make a structure that we can use to crawl in between
          hierarchies and chronologies; and they are the scaffold this website,
          this text, this story builds on.
